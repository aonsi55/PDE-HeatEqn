# Solution to Heat equation Partial Differential Equation
In the provided notebook, one can evaluate a partial differential equation easily using Mathematica, where in the note, we have writen the code to write the partial differential equation, and define the boundary condition, and then obtaining the solution we can verify that the obtained solution, is indeed satisfying the given partial differential equation, and then finally, we plot the obtained solution for the partial differential equation.

## The Problem
In the given notebook we have tried to solve for a partial differential equation which have the following form,
$$\dfrac{\partial y(x,t)}{\partial t} = \dfrac{\partial^2 y(x,t)}{\partial x^2},$$
our choice for the boundary conditions for the purpose of illustration was, 
$$y(x,t) = \sin(\pi x),$$
$$y(0,t) = y(5,t) = 0.$$

It is to be noted that the provided notebook, can be modified to suit any pde given in-hand.
